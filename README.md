# Snake-GUI-game
Snake game as we used to play in the last century on NOKIA mobile phone.
<p>Using the tkinter library for the Graphical User Interface. 
Each time the snake touches the food, the length of the snake is increased per segment and even the snake itself bite own tail, the game is over.
Furthermore, the x and y axis is determined to particular value, which helps to perform the snake inside the particular frame.
The score is displayed and starts with 0 immediately when the user execute the code.</p>
